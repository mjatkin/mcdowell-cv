	\begin{cvsection}{Projects}
		\begin{cvsubsection}{UNIX Clone For ARMv7-A}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed a UNIX-like kernel targeting the ARM Cortex-A15 core in QEMU.
				\item Incorporated exception handling, virtual memory, multitasking, UART driver and keyboard handling.
				\item Diagnosed and debugged problems within the kernel using GDB.
				\item Extensively made use of Git and Github to more easily manage development between multiple developers.
				\item \underline{Utilised}: C++ Programming, ARM Assembly Programming, QEMU, GDB, Git
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Real Time Traffic Controller}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Designed a real time traffic control system for two four-way intersections separated by a train crossing.
				\item Created a custom PCB with NeoPixel LEDs to represent the intersections and train crossing.
				\item Utilised multiple DE-10 Nano nodes and networked IPC to control each intersection/crossing separately.
				\item Implemented fail safe procedures in the system, e.g. if the train controller node goes offline, the adjacent intersection will not route traffic towards the train crossing.
				\item \underline{Utilised}: C++ Programming, Circuit Design, DE-10 Nano, QNX RTOS Programming, Git
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
\iffalse
-Worked in a team of four to develop a real time traffic controller system for two four-way intersections separated by a train crossing.
-The intersections were represented by a custom PCB our team designed and created, utilising NeoPixel LEDs as our traffic lights and push buttons as our pedestrian buttons. 
-The system itself was controlled by four separate micro-controller nodes (DE-10 Nano) running the QNX real time operating system, one for each intersection, one for the train crossing and one more as the controlling/watchdog system. 
-Each node was heavily multi threaded and networked IPC was utilised to communicate between nodes. 
-Node failure was accounted for in the design, with fail safe mechanisms employed to stop potentially dangerous scenarios, e.g. if the train crossing controller node went offline, the adjacent intersections would not route traffic towards the crossing.
-The lights realistically change, transitioning from green to yellow to red in real time, with the transitions being triggered by either timers, or the pedestrian buttons depending on the mode.
-The controller node featured a command line interface, which allowed individual control over each other nodes mode, light configuration and timing.

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Soundcard Device Controller}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Designed an ISA device controller for the Sound Blaster 16 sound card for the DE-10 Nano FPGA.
				\item Created a completely custom riser card to interface the ISA bus connector to the DE-10 Nano GPIO pins.
				\item Diagnosed problems with the riser card and ISA device controller using an oscilloscope.
				\item Configured memory mapped IO between the FPGA and hard processor system and created a device driver.
				\item \underline{Utilised}: C Programming, Verilog Programming, Intel Quartus Prime, Oscilloscope, DE-10 Nano
			\end{itemize}

\iffalse
-In a pair, designed and developed an ISA device controller for the Sound Blaster 16 sound card for the DE-10 Nano SoC.
-A custom riser card was created to interface the ISA bus connector on the sound card to the DE-10 Nano GPIO pins.
-The controller itself was written in Verilog and deployed on the DE-10 Nano FPGA, this consisted of write, read and configuration registers, as well as logic to match the specific timing requirements of the ISA standard.
-Intel Quartus Prime was utilised to memory map the controller registers to the hard processor system, allowing us to write and read from the card transparently through a basic custom driver.
