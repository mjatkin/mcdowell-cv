		\end{cvsubsection}
	\end{cvsection}

	\begin{cvsection}{Projects}
		\begin{cvsubsection}{UNIX Clone For ARMv7-A}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed a UNIX-like kernel targeting the ARM Cortex-A15 core in QEMU.
				\item Incorporated exception handling, virtual memory, multitasking, UART driver and keyboard handling.
				\item Diagnosed and debugged problems within the kernel using GDB.
				\item Extensively made use of Git and Github to more easily manage development between multiple developers.
				\item \underline{Utilised}: C++ Programming, ARM Assembly Programming, QEMU, GDB, Git
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Real Time Traffic Controller}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Designed a real time traffic control system for two four-way intersections separated by a train crossing.
				\item Created a custom PCB with NeoPixel LEDs to represent the intersections and train crossing.
				\item Utilised multiple DE-10 Nano nodes and networked IPC to control each intersection/crossing separately.
				\item Implemented fail safe procedures in the system, e.g. if the train controller node goes offline, the adjacent intersection will not route traffic towards the train crossing.
				\item \underline{Utilised}: C++ Programming, Circuit Design, DE-10 Nano, QNX RTOS Programming, Git
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Soundcard Device Controller}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Designed an ISA device controller for the Sound Blaster 16 sound card for the DE-10 Nano FPGA.
				\item Created a completely custom riser card to interface the ISA bus connector to the DE-10 Nano GPIO pins.
				\item Diagnosed problems with the riser card and ISA device controller using an oscilloscope.
				\item Configured memory mapped IO between the FPGA and hard processor system and created a device driver.
				\item \underline{Utilised}: C Programming, Verilog Programming, Intel Quartus Prime, Oscilloscope, DE-10 Nano
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Arduino LED Matrix}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
